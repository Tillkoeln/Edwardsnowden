UNIX BUILD NOTES
====================
Ubuntu 13.10 build instructions
-------------------------------
Build instructions assume a CLEAN DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT FOR COMPILING.  This is 2014.  If you don't develop complex software in VMs you need to get with the program.  This does not give you compiling options or explain them.  That's up to you to learn.  This makes it work.
