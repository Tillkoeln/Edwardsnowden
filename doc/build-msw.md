You must be able to:
* Read
* Follow instructions
* Type
* Use a mouse
* Install software
* Use Windows Explorer to copy files around

If you cannot do all of those things, (especially the second) do not ask for help.  I'll just make fun of you.

Some operations have steps that are obviously repeated.  I do not go into gory detail every single time, only the first time.

It must be said that this is HARD.  You can and will get seriously frustrated.  When that happens, I walk away for a while and then come back and find the solution.  

* DO NOT be intimidated by the technical jargon.  
* DO NOT be intimidated by the difficulty.  
* DO ask others for help.  
* DO NOT expect anyone to care more about this than you.
* DO READ THE DIRECTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM AND DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVEN'T.
* DO NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR ANYONE WHO CANNOT READ AND FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.

This isn't a coin so much as an MBTI.  I digress.

Having fun yet?  We haven't even gotten started.

2. Download, unpack and build required dependencies.
--------------
a) Create a folder called "deps" on Local Disk (C:) [C:\deps]
b) In Explorer, navigate to C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\ and find "msys.bat".  Double click it to run it.  A window will open that looks like a command prompt.
c) In this section, download all of the files to the C:\deps folder.

2.1 Download OpenSSL: http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz

a) From a MinGw shell (that window we opened), unpack the source archive with tar (this will avoid symlink issues) then configure and make (one command per line):
			cd /c/deps/

			tar xvfz openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz

			cd openssl-1.0.1e

			Configure mingw

			make

Ta da!  You just compiled OpenSSL!

IF THIS FAILS... IF YOU SEE THE WORD "ERROR" OR "WHATEVER OF THE SORT... GO BACK TO STEP 1.5 AND TRY AGAIN.

If it works it doesn't pat you on the back.  It just stops without saying "ERROR".  Welcome to software development.

2.2 Berkeley DB: http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz

I used Berkeley DB 4.8.30 because it worked.  No other reason. 

a)From the MinGW shell, unpack the source archive, configure and make:

	cd /c/deps/

	tar xvfz db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz

	cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix

	../dist/configure --disable-replication --enable-mingw --enable-cxx

	make

2.3 Boost: http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/
--------------
Some of the coddling stops here.  If you've made it this far successfully, you don't need me to hold your hand.

a) Unpack boost inside your C:\deps folder.
b) Then open a command prompt (CMD.EXE), and:

		cd C:\deps\boost_1_55_0\

		bootstrap.bat mingw

		b2 --build-type=complete --with-chrono --with-filesystem --with-program_options --with-system --with-thread toolset=gcc stage

This will compile the required boost libraries and put them into the stage folder (C:\deps\boost_1_55_0\stage).

2.4 Miniupnpc: http://miniupnp.free.fr/files/download.php?file=miniupnpc-1.8.tar.gz
--------------
a) From the MSYS window (remember that?), type:

		tar xvfz miniupnpc-1.8.tar.gz

b) Using Explorer, rename containing folder from "miniupnpc-1.8" to "miniupnpc"
c) Change to the "miniupnpc" directory and find the file named "Makefile.mingw" and open in it Notepad ++
d) Go to line 61 and change "-enable-stdcall-fixup" to "--enable-stdcall-fixup"
e) Save the file
f) then from a Windows command prompt:

		cd C:\deps\miniupnpc

		mingw32-make -f Makefile.mingw init upnpc-static

IF THIS STEP FAILS, REPEAT STEP 1.5!

3.0 Download the AmKoin source code
--------------
a) From a MSYS type:

		cd /c/

		git clone https://github.com/bryceweiner/amkoin

		cd /c/amkoin/src/leveldb

		TARGET_OS=NATIVE_WINDOWS make libleveldb.a libmemenv.a

b) Switch to the command prompt and type:

		cd C:\amkoin\src

		mingw32-make -f makefile.mingw

		strip amkoind.exe

CONGRATULATIONS!  YOU'VE JUST COMPILED A HEADLESS VERSION OF AMKOIN!

Now... for the graphical wallet... and we're going to go really fast because you're a f'in pro now.

4. Compiling Qt 5.2.0 libraries and AmKoin-Qt 
--------------
4.1 Download and unpack Qt base and tools sources:

a) http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/5.2/5.2.0/submodules/qtbase-opensource-src-5.2.0.7z
* Make a directory called C:\Qt
* Unpack the contents of the file into C:\Qt
* Rename the directory from qtbase-opensource-src-5.2.0 to 5.2.0

b) http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/5.2/5.2.0/submodules/qttools-opensource-src-5.2.0.7z
* Unpack the contents of the file into C:\Qt

c) Open a command prompt and type:

	cd\Qt\5.2.0

	configure.bat -release -opensource -confirm-license -static -make libs -no-sql-sqlite -no-opengl -qt-zlib -qt-pcre -no-icu -no-gif -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -no-angle -no-vcproj -no-openssl -no-dbus -no-audio-backend -no-wmf-backend -no-qml-debug

	mingw32-make

e) Remember when we had to check the Path variable before?  We need to do that again.  Reference the instructions above on how to access it.  Add the following path to the beginning:

	C:\Qt\5.2.0\bin;

f) close and reopen the command prompt window so the new path will take effect.

g) Type:

	cd C:\Qt\qttools-opensource-src-5.2.0

	qmake qttools.pro

	mingw32-make

5. Compiling the AmKoin-Qt client
--------------
5.1 In Notepad ++, open the file C:\amkoin\amkoin-qt.pro

a) Go to line 119

b) Add a hashtag to the start of the line so it looks like this:

	#genleveldb.commands = cd $$PWD/src/leveldb && CC=$$QMAKE_CC CXX=$$QMAKE_CXX TARGET_OS=OS_WINDOWS_CROSSCOMPILE $(MAKE) OPT=\"$$QMAKE_CXXFLAGS $$QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE\" libleveldb.a libmemenv.a && $$QMAKE_RANLIB $$PWD/src/leveldb/libleveldb.a && $$QMAKE_RANLIB $$PWD/src/leveldb/libmemenv.a

* This is needed for Windows compiles.  For Linux compiles, remove the hashtag.

5.2 In the command prompt type:

	cd\amkoin

	qmake amkoin-qt.pro

	mingw32-make -f Makefile.Release

YOU DID IT!

Don't forget to create your .conf files!
